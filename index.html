                <h3>About Me</h3>
                
                <p>Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Mason Schleu and I am on my fourth and final year as a Computer Engineering major at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. Primarily I am a student and spend most of my time doing course work. When I am not doing school related work, I have two jobs that I am very passionate about.</p> 
                
                <p>The first is a software development position in which I have the great honor to develop on a platform few others have the opportunity to work with: the Microsoft Hololens. This position is unlike any other. I get to make video games for a platform that is still extremely young. If you dont know, the Hololens is an augmented reality headset. Augmented reality is the computer generated insertion of objects into your real world environment.</p>
                
                <p>My other job is a Biomechanics Research Assistant at the Biomechanics Research Building at UNO. Here, I also have a unique job. Officially, I perform and help with research studies for the professors that work there. Unofficially, I am the resident Computer Engineer. I prototype and make research equipment for the professors who need them.</p>
                
                <p>In addition to my work and school, I have many hobbies and interests which I try to devote a little time to every day. I am truly an engineer at heart, and love making things with my hands. When it comes to projects, I am not picky in the slightest. I will frequently tackle projects on a wide range of involvement from simple art projects I hang on my wall or gift to people, to far more advanced projects involving circuit design and programming components. Luckily, through my job as a research assistant I also have access to a state of the art facility in which I can create my projects on a professional scale. At the Biomechanics Machine shop we have access to a PCB mill, a laser cutter, a 3d printer, any imaginable woodworking equipment, and finally an industrial grade mill. It is here that the UNO Maker Group (UNOMG), the student organization I am president of, runs and operates.</p>
                
                <p>On the rare occasion I am not doing homework, work for my two jobs, or doing administrative activities for the UNOMG, you will most likely find me spending time with my girfriend, Nancy, or playing video games. Funnily enough, I am quite like my idol, Elon Musk. While I am far from founding at least four of the worlds most influencial companies, I have a strong passion for gaming. I can credit where I am today for my interest in electronics, which sparked from my desire to build my own gmaing PC ever since high school.</p>
